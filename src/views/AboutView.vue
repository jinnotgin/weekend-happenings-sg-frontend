			<p>As a Singaporean, I've often hear friends lament that,</p>
			<quote class="ml-5 italic">"There's nothing much to do here."</quote>

				feel like a tiresome process of googling endlessly and sifting through
				countless websites. ðŸ˜¢

			<p>
				That's exactly why "Now In Singapore" was created - its a one-stop
				starter guide to discovering the pulse of Singapore! ðŸŒŸ
			</p>
			<p>
				"Now In Singapore" will routinely scour the internet to compile a
				comprehensive list of events happening all over Singapore. From festive
				celebrations to special events, it's all curated and updated for you,
				significantly reducing the hassle when finding the perfect outing.
