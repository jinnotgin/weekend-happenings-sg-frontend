# Now In Singapore · Frontend

The Now In Singapore frontend powers [nowinsg.com](https://nowinsg.com), a curated guide to what's happening across Singapore right now. It surfaces concerts, community gatherings, food pop-ups, museum exhibits, and other noteworthy experiences so locals and visitors can plan their weekends without scrolling through countless listings.

This repository contains the Vue 3 single-page application that renders the public experience. It consumes structured event data generated by the companion data pipeline at [data.nowinsg.com](https://data.nowinsg.com) and presents it through a playful, mobile-friendly interface optimised for quick discovery.

## Highlights

- **Curated events feed** – Automatically refreshed listings grouped by date range, category, and region so you can jump straight to what matters most.
- **Location-savvy browsing** – Optional "Near me" filters use lightweight geolocation to spotlight happenings within ~10 km of the visitor.
- **Source transparency** – Every event links back to its original source, with attribution surfaced in the UI so readers can explore further.
- **AI-assisted summaries** – Event copy, categories, and highlights are distilled with the help of large language models, keeping descriptions succinct while retaining key details.
- **Responsive experience** – Built with Tailwind CSS and layout primitives tailored to phone-first exploration, while still feeling delightful on tablets and desktops.

## Technology Stack

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with the `<script setup>` composition API
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and builds
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management of events, categories, and filters
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) for client-side navigation between the main feed and informational pages
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and Floating Vue for styling and popovers

## Data Flow

Event, location, and attribution data is generated upstream and published to `https://data.nowinsg.com/latest`. The frontend fetches the following resources on load:

- `events.json` – Normalised event documents with categories, date ranges, and resolved thumbnails
- `sources.json` – Metadata about each curated source, surfaced inside the "Sources" drawer
- `generationTime.json` – Timestamp indicating when the dataset was last refreshed, shown to visitors

See [`src/stores/events.js`](src/stores/events.js) for the Pinia store responsible for fetching and shaping this data.
